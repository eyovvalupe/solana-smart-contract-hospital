## About

This is a medical supply system built using rust and to be based on the NEAR protocol, which provides the ability for the health sector to be able to fund and distribute medical supplies safely while maintaining transparency and accountability. Citizens can see who Supplied what, to who, when and for how much without posing a threat to the security of the supply system.

## How it works

There will be an approved list of hospital names in the country stored on the smart contract to ensure supplies are only made to supply to approved and real hospitals. <br>
Source of funds is the government ministry of health or private companies that would wish to provide medical funding in open manner.\
Suppliers should all be approved accounts of either public or private types. The worth of supplies done by the suppliers will also be logged to make sure that no one single entity is benefiting with no solid reason.\
All supply Items will also be pre-declared and stored in the smart contract storage with metadata such as code name, manufacturer, product description and date.\
When a transaction or funding request is made it has to meet a list of requirements to proceed. The payment method will be in NEAR tokens on the blockchain thus secure but public.
